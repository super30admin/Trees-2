/**Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3]

1
/ \

2 3 Output: 25 Explanation:

The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.

The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25. Example 2:

Input: [4,9,0,5,1]

4
/ \

9 0

/ \

5 1 Output: 1026 Explanation:

The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.

The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.

The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.

Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

// Time Complexity : O(n) (as processing is done on each node only once)

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
//First start with Recursive solution. We will follow BFS approach,
//because we have to cover/visit each nodes simultaneously at each level
//while in DFS, if the leaf node reaches null child(left), recursion will stop and it won't visit right chill of that node

# Trees-2

## Problem1 ()
Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]


postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Return the following binary tree:

   3


   / \


  9  20


    /  \


   15   7
   
   ## Problem2 (https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)
   Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3]

    1

   / \

  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:

The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.

The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
Example 2:

Input: [4,9,0,5,1]

    4

   / \

  9   0

 / \

5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:

The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.

The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.

The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.

Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

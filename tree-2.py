# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

#Problem 1:Construct Binary Tree from inorder and Poster order Traversal
#Time Complexity O(n)
#space complexity O(n)
#Worked on leetcode?: YES
'''
Posterorder follows this logic: store the furthest element left , then if it's terminated, go to
the element that is directly on the right (not children) of this element. Then store as if you
restarted the postorder traversal. So the rule, furthest left, if terminated, store, go right,
if terminated, store, else traverse postorder, if left and right were terminated, store the
root node.

So reversed postorder is like preorder but right first, then left.
'''
'''
Main idea: Given the symmetry of postorder and preorder explained above, it's the same as for inorder and postorder,
but this time, the last element represents the head of the present tree and we go right first, then left.

#Problem 2: Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
#time complexity: O(n)
#space complexity: O(h^2), h height of the tree and the strings
#did it work on leetcode:yes
'''
brute force: Traverse each branch , by starting from the root each time
'''

'''
Main idea : As it traverses the tree, preorder,Keep the present string in the local memory (call stack) , when the branch is terminated,add the string to the total sum.
